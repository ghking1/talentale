## Introduction

#### What

TalenTale aims to utilize "Expertise2Earn" to build a decentralized talent network with an advanced-algorithm-controlled resume marketplace circulated, governed, and expanded by network participants.

#### Why

So far, there is no qualified talent recruitment platform for the Web 3.0 field along with the emerging trend of its development. So, we hope to build this decentralized network to fill the unmet needs. Also, we plan to expand the platform to the mass talent acquisition market in the future to capture the global talent acquisition & staffing technology and services market, which is estimated to reach US$ 140.7 Bn in 2022. Meanwhile, the freelancing market is also growing drastically, requiring a new and flexible talent matching format.

#### How

To fill the gap, we built the “Expertise to earn” requirement platform through NFTlizing the talents’ resumes and promoting Social-Fi. After the talents register the account on our platform, they can start to mint NFTs based on their past experiences. And then, those NFTs will be put into the secondary market, where the NFTs could be sold or recommended to the matching jobs of the matching companies.

On TalenTale, we will polymerize the price trend analysis system and connector recommendation systems together to develop a more advanced algorithm in addition to the NLP process, which is applied by most talent recruitment platforms.

Thus, companies can recruit talents with a lower cost and higher efficiency. The talents’ real value can be embodied and monetized. Additionally, the connectors could earn money by matching talents to appropriate job positions. In this case, we convert the connectors or the so-called market makers into assistant talent analysts. 

The network will run on the polygon network with a native token TLT, which users can earn by introducing talents and corporate to the community. In addition, corporates use TLTs to enhance their job postings, and talents will use TLTs for hunting for jobs or garnering professional knowledge.

#### DAO

For the governance protocol, we will apply a one-token, one-vote system that gives TLT holders proportional control over how the network is governed. Only the top 50 TLT holders can hand in new proposals. These native token uses will provide strong incentives to corporates and talents to activate the network and community.

#### Team

Team members come from Ivy League colleges and top universities with years of development or product experience. Our team believes that only through real-world impact can Web3.0 revolute the world. Boosted by tokens, we re-allocate resources and fortune, which are monopolized by centralized platforms.
